This repository contains a project that predicts Formula 1 qualifying lap times using historical F1 data fetched via the FastF1 library. 
The project demonstrates data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, and training a regression model to predict lap times Q3 sessions.

procedure

Preprocess and clean lap time data (Q1, Q2, Q3).

Convert lap times to seconds for regression.

Build a linear regression model to predict qualifying times.

Evaluate model performance using MAE and RÂ² score.
